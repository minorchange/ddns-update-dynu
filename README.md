# ddns-update-dynu


Use update.sh to update the mapping of ip address to your url managed by the dyndns service dynu.
In order to make it work you need to create an account at dynu.com
If you put your credentials in the config_DUMMY.txt file and rename it to config.txt the update.sh script will pick them up.
Depending on your scenario it might make sense to regularly run update.sh via a cronjob.
